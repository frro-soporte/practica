@section DESCRIPTION

MeloSynth: synthesize a melody

MeloSynth is a python script to synthesize melodies represented as a sequence of
pitch (frequency) values. It was written to synthesize the output of the
MELODIA Melody Extraction Vamp Plugin (http://mtg.upf.edu/technologies/melodia),
but can be used to synthesize any pitch sequence represented as a two-column txt
or csv file where the first column contains timestamps and the second contains
the corresponding frequency values in Hertz.

@section USAGE

usage: melosynth.py [-h] [--output OUTPUT] [--fs FS] [--nHarmonics NHARMONICS]
                    [--square] [--useneg] [--batch]
                    inputfile

positional arguments:
  inputfile             Path to input file containing the pitch sequence

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --output OUTPUT       Path to output wav file. If not specified a file will
                        be created with the same path/name as inputfile but
                        ending with "_melosynth.wav".
  --fs FS               Sampling frequency for the synthesized file. If not
                        specified the default value of 16000 Hz is used.
  --nHarmonics NHARMONICS
                        Number of harmonics (including the fundamental) to use
                        in the synthesis (default is 1). As the number is
                        increased the wave will become more sawtooth-like.
  --square              Converge to square wave instead of sawtooth as the
                        number of harmonics is increased.
  --useneg              By default, negative frequency values (unvoiced
                        frames) are synthesized as silence. Setting the
                        --useneg option will synthesize these frames using
                        their absolute values (i.e. as voiced frames).
  --batch               Treat inputfile as a folder and batch process every
                        file within this folder that ends with .csv or .txt.
                        If --output is specified it is expected to be a folder
                        too. If --output is not specified, all synthesized
                        files will be saved into the input folder.


@section EXAMPLES

Basic usage, without any options:

>python melosynth.py ~/Documents/daisy3_melodia.csv

This will create a file called daisy3_melodia_melosynth.wav in the same folder
as the input file (~/Documents/) and use all the default parameter values for
the synthesis.

Advanced usage, including options:

>python melosynth.py ~/Documents/daisy3_melodia.csv --output ~/Music/mynewfile.wav --fs 44100 --nHarmonics 10 --square --useneg

Here we are providing a specified path for the output instead of the default
location. Next we specify the sample rate for the output (44.1 kHz) instead of
the default value of 16000 Hz. Next, we specify the number of harmonics to use
(10) instead of the default value of 1. Normally, as the number of harmonics is
increased the waveform will converge to a sawtooth wave, however, since we
specify the --square option, it will converge to a square wave instead. Finally,
by specifying the --useneg (use negative) option we make the script use the
absolute value of the frequencies so that negative frequencies are not
synthesized as silence (which is the default behaviour).

Batch processing:

>python melosynth.py ~/Documents/melodia_pitch/ --output ~/Documents/melodia_synth/ --batch

This will batch process all files ending with .txt or .csv in the melodia_pitch
folder, and save the synthesized melodies into the melodia_synth folder. Every
synthesized file will have the same name as its corresponding input file but
with the ending _melosynth.wav.

@section INSTALLATION
Simply download the script and run it from your terminal as instructed above.
Dependencies: python (tested on 2.7) and numpy (http://www.numpy.org/)
