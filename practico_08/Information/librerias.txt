Flask.url_for
Generates a URL to the given endpoint with the method provided.

Flask.render_template
Renders a template from the template folder with the given context.

Flask.request
The request object used by default in Flask. 
It is what ends up as request. If you want to replace the request object used you can subclass this and set request_class to your subclass.

Flask.flash
Flashes a message to the next request. In order to remove the flashed message from the session and to display it to the user, the template has to call get_flashed_messages().

Flask_sqlAlchemy
Flask_sqlalchemy is an extension for Flask that adds support for SQLAlchemy to your application. It aims to simplify using SQLAlchemy with Flask by providing useful defaults and extra helpers that make it easier to accomplish common tasks.
